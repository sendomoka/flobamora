          "With a length that can reach approximately 3 meters and a weight exceeding 70kg, the Komodo Dragon, scientifically known as Varanus Komodoensis, stands as the largest lizard and reptile on Earth. Recognizable by their immense size, flat heads, bowed legs, lengthy thick tails, and forked tongues, these dragons exhibit remarkable physical features. Capable of reaching speeds up to 20kph on land and displaying adept swimming skills, Komodos possess excellent vision, allowing them to perceive objects from a distance of 300 meters. Functioning as formidable predators, these carnivores can consume up to 80% of their body weight in a single feeding. Their diet includes substantial prey like water buffaloes, deer, carrion, pigs, and, notably, even humans. Employing a distinctive hunting technique, especially against large prey like water buffaloes, Komodos encircle their victim, patiently waiting for the slow-acting venom in their saliva to take effect. Once incapacitated, the prey is torn apart and devoured entirely, bones included. If the prey manages to escape, it often succumbs within 24 hours due to the poisonous and bacteria-laden saliva.",
          "Exclusive to the Komodo National Park and the surrounding Flores island, these Jurassic and majestic creatures stand as the park's star attraction. While witnessing them is awe-inspiring, visitors are strongly advised to maintain a safe distance and exercise caution. It is imperative to be accompanied by a ranger and adhere to all given instructions when in proximity to these potentially dangerous lizards, despite their seemingly docile appearance.",
